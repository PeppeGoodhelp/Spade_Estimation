This repository contains code for preprocessing the MNIST data (class 0-1 and class 6-9) with the HG SPADE algorithm as shown in:

Sub-diffraction estimation, discrimination and learning of quantum states of light: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03179

Furthemore a working Random Forest algorithm is in place for performing the classification using the extracted features.
